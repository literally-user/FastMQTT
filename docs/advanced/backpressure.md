# Backpressure

## `receive_buffer_size`

By default, the internal message queue for each `Subscription` is unbounded. Set `receive_buffer_size` to cap it:

```python
async with client.subscribe("telemetry/#", receive_buffer_size=100) as sub:
    async for msg in sub:
        await slow_process(msg)
```

`receive_buffer_size` is passed directly to `asyncio.Queue(maxsize=...)`. When the queue is full, `put()` blocks.

## How flow control works

The library's read loop (`_read_loop`) reads packets from the TCP stream and dispatches them. When a `Subscription` queue is full:

1. The relay task that moves messages from the internal protocol queue to your subscription queue blocks on `queue.put()`.
2. The protocol's internal queue for that filter fills up.
3. `_read_loop` stops reading new data from the socket.
4. The TCP receive buffer fills.
5. The TCP stack signals backpressure to the broker via window size reduction.

The result is end-to-end flow control: a slow consumer naturally slows the broker's publish rate without any explicit coordination code.

## When to use it

Use `receive_buffer_size` when:

- Your message handler is slow (I/O-bound, database writes, etc.) and you want to bound memory usage.
- You need guaranteed processing of every message without unbounded queue growth.
- You are implementing a consumer that must apply backpressure to upstream producers.

Leave it at the default (`0` = unbounded) when:

- Message arrival rate is low or bounded.
- You buffer messages yourself (e.g. writing to a database in batches).
- You prefer to drop or log excess rather than slow the broker.

!!! warning
    Applying backpressure affects all topics multiplexed on the same TCP connection. A slow consumer on one `Subscription` will stall delivery to all other subscriptions on the same client. If you need independent flow control per topic, use separate clients.
