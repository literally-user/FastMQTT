# fastmqtt

Pure asyncio MQTT 3.1.1 and 5.0 client library. No paho dependency, no threading, no god classes.

## Why not aiomqtt?

[aiomqtt](https://github.com/sbtinstruments/aiomqtt) is a thin async wrapper around paho-mqtt.
You inherit paho's threading model, 10 000-line files, and implicit global state — just with `async/await` painted on top.

fastmqtt is built from scratch:

| | fastmqtt | aiomqtt (paho) |
|---|---|---|
| I/O model | pure asyncio | paho threads + asyncio bridge |
| Packet codec | pure functions, I/O-free | paho internals |
| MQTT 5.0 | native, typed properties dataclasses | partial |
| Type annotations | strict mypy | partial |
| Backpressure | bounded subscription queues | none |
| QoS 2 | full state machine | paho impl |

## Installation

```bash
pip install fastmqtt
```

## Quick start

```python
import asyncio
from fastmqtt import MQTTClient

async def main():
    async with MQTTClient("broker.example.com") as client:
        async with client.subscribe("sensors/#") as messages:
            async for msg in messages:
                print(msg.topic, msg.payload)

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Publish

```python
async with MQTTClient("broker.example.com") as client:
    await client.publish("sensors/temperature", b"23.5", qos=1)
```

## QoS levels

```python
from fastmqtt import QoS

await client.publish("topic", b"data", qos=QoS.AT_LEAST_ONCE)   # QoS 1
await client.publish("topic", b"data", qos=QoS.EXACTLY_ONCE)    # QoS 2
```

## Manual acknowledgement

Hold the PUBACK/PUBREC until your application has durably processed the message:

```python
async with client.subscribe("orders/#", auto_ack=False) as messages:
    async for msg in messages:
        await save_to_database(msg)
        await msg.ack()  # broker will redeliver if we crash before this
```

## Subscription as explicit get

Useful when interleaving message handling with other async work:

```python
async with client.subscribe("sensors/#") as messages:
    msg = await messages.get_message()
    print(msg.topic, msg.payload)
```

## Reconnection

`MQTTClient` reconnects automatically with exponential backoff. Active subscriptions
are transparently re-registered after reconnect — your `async for` loop keeps running.

## MQTT 5.0

Pass `version=5` to use MQTT 5.0. Properties are typed dataclasses:

```python
from fastmqtt import MQTTClient
from fastmqtt.packets.properties import PublishProperties

async with MQTTClient("broker.example.com", version=5) as client:
    props = PublishProperties(content_type="application/json")
    await client.publish("topic", b'{"value": 42}', properties=props)
```

## Architecture

```
src/fastmqtt/
  packets/        # I/O-free codec: frozen dataclasses + pure encode/decode
  transport/      # thin asyncio reader/writer (TCP, TLS)
  state.py        # session state, QoS 2 state machine
  protocol.py     # packet dispatch, ping loop, flow control
  client.py       # public API: MQTTClient, Subscription
```

The codec layer has zero asyncio imports — every packet type is a frozen dataclass,
serialization and parsing are pure functions. This makes the entire codec trivially testable.
